# Contributing to Job Portal

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Job Portal as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/p4r1ch4y/job-portal.git
cd job-portal
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
Copy `.env.example` files and configure them:
```bash
# Backend
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

# Frontend
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
```

4. **Start development servers**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Code Style

### JavaScript/React
- Use ES6+ features
- Follow React Hooks patterns
- Use functional components over class components
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### CSS/Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use semantic color names

### Backend
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Use async/await over promises
- Implement proper error handling
- Add input validation for all endpoints
- Use meaningful HTTP status codes

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
fix(dashboard): resolve stats calculation error
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(components): improve button hover effects
```

## Testing

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
```

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

### End-to-End Testing
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Code Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: All PRs must pass automated checks (linting, tests, build)
2. **Peer Review**: At least one maintainer must review and approve the PR
3. **Testing**: Ensure all new features are tested
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
